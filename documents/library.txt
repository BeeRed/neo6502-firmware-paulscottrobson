Libraries
=========

Library code all have the line number 0. This cannot be typed in, it has to be done using cross development.

It also means you cannot use GOTO or GOSUB

Libraries should use . notation e.g. rtc.initialise() rtc.get.hour() and so on.

Todo
----
Disable 0 as a line number (if not already the case)
LIST defaults to 1 as the lower value (LIST 0 still works)
RENUMBER ignores preceding zero lines
NEW leaves zero numbered lines. This involves a "cold new"
OLD is unchanged
The editor should ignore zero lines.
Zero line numbers should print the index into the library on error (e.g. LINE 0:12)
Function LIBRARY which works like LIST - zeros if range provided, else does RENUM.
