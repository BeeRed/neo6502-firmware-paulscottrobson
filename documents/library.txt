Libraries
=========

Library code all have the line number 0. This cannot be typed in, it has to be done using cross development.

It also means you cannot use GOTO or GOSUB

Libraries should use . notation e.g. rtc.initialise() rtc.get.hour() and so on.

Todo
----

Zero line numbers should print the index into the library on error or similar. (e.g. LINE 0:12)

Function LIBRARY which works like LIST - zeros if range provided, else does RENUM.

Explain what it does.

Done
----
Disable 0 as a line number (if not already the case)
LIST defaults to 1 as the lower value (LIST 0 still works)
RUN skips over line zeroes.
OLD is unchanged
NEW leaves zero numbered lines. This involves a "cold new"
	- we have to leaved the variable table unchanged.
	- if there is no extended code zero the table as normally.
RENUMBER ignores preceding zero lines



Later
-----
The editor should ignore zero lines.
